# 🔍 Hospital Management System - Complete Workflow Analysis

## ✅ Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL API ENDPOINT FIXES**
- ❌ **Fixed**: `getDoctorsData()` was calling `/api/user/doctors` (non-existent)
- ✅ **Now**: Calls `/api/doctor/list` (correct endpoint)
- ❌ **Fixed**: Login was calling `/api/register` instead of `/api/user/register`
- ✅ **Now**: Calls `/api/user/register` and `/api/user/login`

### 2. **ADMIN PANEL ROUTING ISSUE**
- ❌ **Problem**: AdminLogin redirects to `/admin-panel` (doesn't exist)
- ⚠️ **Needs Fix**: Should redirect to actual admin panel URL

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. **Admin Panel Integration**
The admin login currently redirects to `/admin-panel` which doesn't exist. Options:
- **Option A**: Deploy admin panel separately and redirect to that URL
- **Option B**: Integrate admin panel into main app with proper routing

### 2. **Environment Variables**
Current setup uses empty `VITE_BACKEND_URL` which works for same-domain deployment.

### 3. **Database Seeding**
No sample doctors in database. Need to:
- Add sample doctors via admin panel
- Or seed database with initial data
